Hi - My name's Kevin - I am a student at UBC studying Statistics.

I'm very new to coding. I tried Javascript when I was very young, but that didn't get anywhere. 
It was only after I took CPSC 110 at UBC (In Racket) in 2021 where I learned how fun and useful coding is to the everyday world and how much I want to pursue it.

I may upload a few of my small projects on here as I'm learning the world of code; at this moment, I'm taking classes at UBC learning R and Java.
I might learn additional languages and will update this page.

Thank you for visiting!
