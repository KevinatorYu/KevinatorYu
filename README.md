I recently graduated from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelors of Science in Statistics, a Minor in Data Science, and multiple internship experiences within the Canadian public sector. These experiences have given me many opportunities to make meaningful contributions to organizations that prioritizes integrity, DEI, teamwork, evidence-based decision making, among many others.

With my experiences in Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada as well as Statistics Canada, I possess a variety of skills in the knowledge and understanding of data, data systems, and statistical software applications. I've also applied skills in economics, financial modelling, and risk management in mission-critical surveys such as the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Census of Population.

I plan to put some of my projects here; ranging from Statistics Canada datasets to Elo rating Systems for the NHL. Thank you for visiting!
